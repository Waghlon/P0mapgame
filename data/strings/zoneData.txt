Computer Graphics	 Shapes, sprites and polygons. The world of computer graphics will always be closely related to programming. To make your ideas work in real life, you will work with the tools necessary to make 2D and 3D graphics.	_At AAU, you will begin on computer graphics along with the programming, starting on day one.
Physical Design	 The digital world is a wonderful world, but at some point you will need to work with real life as well. Physical design helps you taking your project from a sketch to the real world.	AAU is a land of wonders and technology: 3D printers, electrical labs, workshops with wood and metal. All is possible!
Interaction Design	 Medialogy is nothing without the user, young one. And the user is a strange person. If you haven’t made your idea easy to use, they will just go play Farmville.	With interaction design, you will learn how users think and how to help them enjoy your idea.
